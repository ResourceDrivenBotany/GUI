Notes on GUI


- Need to keep action screen static. One can pull different panes in action/game screen over other stuff
- make text areas read only
- Action screen resolution too high - cant see all stuff
- consider moving the player action buttons and labels to the left and consider a more vertical layout
- turn action text boxes into buttons
- Turn player names into buttons that can be enabled when attacking. Gets rid of checkboxes
- determine necesiity of scoreboard
- back button on top left
- Text areas need to be read only
- consolidate player info areas
- love the fade in effect
- scaling? seems difficult might not have time
- continue button leads to game list screen and not current game in aciton
- new game doesnt lead to game list screen/no game list screen in main menu possibly. Possibly a design decision 
- lock down plant types
